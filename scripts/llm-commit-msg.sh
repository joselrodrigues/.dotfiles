PROMPT="You are an expert at following Conventional Commits and commitlint rules. Generate a commit message following these STRICT rules:

COMMITLINT RULES (MANDATORY):
- type-enum: ONLY use: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- scope-empty: MUST have a scope (never empty)
- type-case: type MUST be lowercase
- subject-case: subject MUST be lowercase
- subject-empty: subject MUST NOT be empty
- subject-full-stop: subject MUST NOT end with period
- header-max-length: first line MUST be â‰¤ 72 characters

FORMAT: type(scope): subject

Current branch: $BRANCH

SCOPE RULES:
- Use branch name as scope: $BRANCH
- If branch has prefixes like \"feature/\", \"fix/\", use the part after \"/\"
- Keep scope concise and lowercase

Return ONLY the commit message, no explanations.
